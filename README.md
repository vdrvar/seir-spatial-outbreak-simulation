# Simulation of a Spatial SEIR Model
Simulations related to a Bachelor's Thesis at LMU Munich

In this repo, you can find the simulations related to the spatial SEIR models.
Such models generalize classical SEIR ones that are only charactarized via differential equations, without considering any spatial relations.
