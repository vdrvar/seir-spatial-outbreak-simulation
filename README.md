# Simulation of a Spatial SEIR Model

Simulations related to a Bachelor's Thesis at LMU Munich inspired by the outbreak of COVID-19.

This repository contains simulations related to spatial SEIR models, which generalize classical SEIR models by considering spatial relations. The models are characterized by differential equations, incorporating spatial factors that influence disease transmission dynamics.

## Model Implementation

The model was designed and implemented in C++ using stochastic modeling techniques. Below are examples demonstrating the development of an epidemic, with different scenarios based on stochastic parameters:

### Controlled Outbreak Scenario

This scenario depicts a controlled outbreak, reflecting a situation where government intervention effectively limits disease spread.

### Risky Spreading Scenario

In this scenario, stochastic parameters suggest a higher risk of disease spread, highlighting the importance of proactive measures to prevent escalation.

### Total Outbreak Scenario

The total outbreak scenario represents a situation where disease transmission is unchecked, underscoring the urgency of containment efforts.

These simulations offer insights into the dynamics of spatial SEIR models and the potential impact of different intervention strategies on disease control.
